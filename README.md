# Nekoweb Tracker

Allows you to track page views over time.

Simple, fast and easily customizable thanks to the simple source code.

## Configuration

First install dependencies inside of `requirements.txt`

Then run `configure.py`, which will set up the rest for you. You enter your username, and it sets up the project.

Set up a cron to run `main.py` to run it at whatever interval you choose, that's up to you.

Additionally, you can set up a Discord webhook to send updates to a channel. All you need to do is edit `config.json` and set `"webhook": "URL"`.
